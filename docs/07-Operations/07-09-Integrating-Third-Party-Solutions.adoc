== Integrating Third-Party Solutions

=== Overview

Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS supports integration with third-party solutions that enhance monitoring, security, compliance, and operational capabilities of your multi-account environment. These integrations can be implemented using the `customizations-config.yaml` file, which allows you to deploy third-party solutions using CloudFormation stacks and StackSets across your AWS organization.

=== Integration Methods

There are two primary approaches for integrating third-party solutions with LZA:

1. *CloudFormation-Based Integration*: For solutions that provide CloudFormation templates
   * Single-account deployments using [CloudFormation Stacks](https://awslabs.github.io/landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws/latest/typedocs/interfaces/___packages__aws_accelerator_config_lib_models_customizations_config.ICloudFormationStack.html)
   * Multi-account deployments using [CloudFormation StackSets](https://awslabs.github.io/landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws/latest/typedocs/interfaces/___packages__aws_accelerator_config_lib_models_customizations_config.ICloudFormationStackSet.html)

2. *Manual Integration*: For solutions that cannot be deployed via CloudFormation
   * Configuration through the AWS console or provider-specific methods
   * Integration with existing LZA resources post-deployment

=== Common Integration Patterns

==== Monitoring and Observability Solutions

Third-party monitoring and observability solutions are typically deployed using a hub-and-spoke model:

* *Hub*: Central collection and analysis platform, typically deployed in a shared services account
* *Spokes*: Agents or forwarders deployed across accounts to collect and send data to the hub

Integration considerations:

* *Cross-Account Access*: These solutions require appropriate IAM roles and permissions across accounts
* *Log Collection*: Often utilize centralized logging solutions like CloudWatch Logs
* *Agent Deployment*: May require agent installation on EC2 instances or container environments

==== Deployment Strategy

1. *Shared Services Model*:
   * Deploy the central monitoring components in the SharedServices account
   * Use StackSets to deploy agents or connectors across target accounts
   * Configure cross-account IAM roles for resource access

2. *Integration Prerequisites*:
   * Network connectivity between accounts (often using VPC endpoints or AWS Transit Gateway)
   * Central authentication and authorization mechanisms
   * Logging and telemetry aggregation capabilities

=== Example Integration Approach

For third-party monitoring and security solutions:

1. *Initial Setup*:
   * Deploy central components through CloudFormation in the SharedServices account
   * Create necessary IAM roles and policies for cross-account access
   * Set up log collection and forwarding mechanisms

2. *Account Integration*:
   * Use CloudFormation StackSets to deploy agents across accounts
   * Configure integration with AWS services like CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Config
   * Establish automated provisioning for new accounts

=== Conclusion

While LZA provides a flexible framework for third-party integrations through the `customizations-config.yaml` file, the specific implementation details will vary based on the solution being integrated. Organizations should consider their operational requirements, security posture, and deployment strategy when incorporating third-party solutions into their LZA environment.
